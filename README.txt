

To Add:
- Note I'm not including the downloading of reference files in the prepatory step since we want to seamlessly integrate new refs when they are published (ie just uping the download link in Module2)

Notes:
- I want to extract each module from my huge scan_perm.nf now to just be unique modules. Also, I want to rename them 01_ etc
so theyre aligned with results dir
- need to update new PREPARE_GENOME_SCAN because its taking suspiciously long - more memory/cpu 
- need to ensure HPC parallelization is working 
- need to train cc on new context-tracker agent
